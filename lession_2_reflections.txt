Reflections:
1) What happnes when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Me: When you intitialize a repository, it creates .git directory. It just intializes
the directory, no commits are there. We need to initialize it to prepare the directory 
for handlng version change through git.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains local content, repository contains the version controlled files
which are committed. Staging area is between the working directory and the repository.
It offers you an area where you can add files that you want to commit to the repository
otherwise you may end up committing everything. It's like a local snapshot.
