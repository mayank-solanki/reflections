1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Me: We will use remote repository when multiple people are collaborating on single project
and are working remotely from different places. If we will keep all our work local then 
only we will able to access the work other people can't collaborate on it. If we are working
alone then local copy can be good option. But in this case also for eg we want to work from
some different machine then it will be great if we have remote repository.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
Me: If we pull changes manually then we can prevent un wanted errors that may happen when you
are working on same files, or you want to compile something and you don't want other changes
to come in your build. Other synced changes might contain errors.
