1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Me: We will use remote repository when multiple people are collaborating on single project
and are working remotely from different places. If we will keep all our work local then 
only we will able to access the work other people can't collaborate on it. If we are working
alone then local copy can be good option. But in this case also for eg we want to work from
some different machine then it will be great if we have remote repository.
